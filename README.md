# DSS BT-Risk

This is a proof-of-concept (PofC) graphical user interface (using the PyQt library) for a decision suport system.
Under the hood it is running the Bayesian network ((using the PyAgrum library)) presented in the publication [1].

**Since it is a PofC, Several functionalities are missing!**
